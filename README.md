# Noah's Awesome Homepage
Hello reader! I wanted to make this project to practice my Node React skills while having some fun along the way. Below is how you will run the project on your local machine, as it is not yet running on AWS.

## Running instructions
Open up 2 command line terminals. Use one to navigate to the "my-first-app-api" folder, then run "node ./API.js". Use the other to navigate to the "my-first-app" folder, and run "npm start". Once that is done the webpage will be open and ready to use - have fun! :)
